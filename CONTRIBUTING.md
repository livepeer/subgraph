# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to our subgraph. We want this to be friendly, clear,
and low-friction for everyone.

## Ways to contribute

- Report a bug or regression.
- Propose a feature or improvement.
- Improve docs or tests.
- Help with reviews.

## Issues first, then assignments

For most work, please open an issue before starting:

1. Create or find the issue.
2. Ask to be assigned in a comment.
3. Wait for a maintainer to assign you before starting work.

This helps us avoid duplicated effort and align on scope.

## Pull request workflow

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from the default branch.
2. Keep changes focused and scoped to the issue.
3. Add tests or update docs where appropriate.
4. Open a PR and link the issue it resolves.

## Deployment workflow

1. CI deploys a Subgraph Studio preview and posts the link as a PR comment.
2. Reviewers should confirm the Studio deployment fully syncs without errors.
3. After approval, merge to `main` to trigger a testnet deployment (if enabled).
4. Tag releases publish to the on-chain Graph Network (any tag triggers the workflow).
